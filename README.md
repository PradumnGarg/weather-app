# weather_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project was made to understand how API calls and JSON parsing is done and so no attention has been given to user interface or user experience. There are 3 screens:- loading,city selection and weather result based on city selected.

Below are few screenshots of the same:-
